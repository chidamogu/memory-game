# memory-game

A project I created in my first year as a computer science major in my CMPUT 174 class at the University of Alberta. Coded in python using pygame.

The point of the game is to match up all the images together as quickly as possible. The user can only uncover two of the images at once and has to wait for them to flip over before uncovering two more images. When two matching images have been uncovered, they will stay uncovered. The goal of the game is to match the images as quickly as possible.
